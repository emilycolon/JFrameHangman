# JFrame Hangman
I just started learning Java and came across [this wonderful tutorial](https://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/321933-creating-a-calculator-using-jframe/) on how to create a calculator using JFrame. This was the first Java "application" I was able to get to work 100% correctly.  After looking around for other little projects I could possibly tackle, I decided that I'd try to do Hangman using JFrame as well!

Credit must definitely be given to [schutzzz](https://www.dreamincode.net/forums/user/625374-schutzzz/) on Dream in Code as I essentially used their calculator code as a starting base and then changed what I needed to in order to change it to Hangman.  

Visually, this game is still not pretty, but I'm happy I was able to get the game logic working correctly!
